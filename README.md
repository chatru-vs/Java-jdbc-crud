# Java-jdbc-crud
java quary language to create the connection and do the CRUD Opertion on  MySQL
This JDBC Quary is going to help you learning how to do basic database operations (CRUD - Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete) using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API. These CRUD operations are equivalent to the INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE statements in SQL language. Although the target database system is MySQL, but the same technique can be applied for other database systems as well because the query syntax used is standard SQL which is supported by all relational database systems.
We will learn how to do insert, query, update and delete database records by writing code to manage records of a table Users in a MySQL database called SampleDB.
